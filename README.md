# IMDb-Rating-Chart

This branch was planned to refactor the code and use [IMDb datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).

But due the tough ToS of IMDb datasets, this script can't be realized without issues...
Meanwhile I found also a issue about the same problem: https://github.com/obtuseio/tv/issues/8
